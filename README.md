# MatMP

Collection of useful multiprocessing approaches to common matrix operations (e.g. multiplication of two matrices, LU factorization of a square matrix).

This repository is the result of a university project about advanced processor architectures and the application of our knowledge about caching and multi-threading. The code is written in C++ language and takes advantage of the OpenMP library.
